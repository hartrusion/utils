# Utils
Common used classes for my projects. Contains some helper classes and a 
model view controller implementation for swing applications. As I'm just an 
engineer and no experienced java programmer, this might not be of use for 
you at all.
It also serves as an exercise on how to use git and github.

### ArrayExt
I use java for doing things I was doing in MATLAB/Octave before and had to code 
some small helper functions that make the use of arrays a little easier. Those 
array extensions allow quick modification of arrays. It is not that common as 
java provides collections for such cases.

### MVC Package
The MVC package contains a model view controller implementation that is designed
for controlling an application with a swing UI. It uses strings to identify 
property changes and actions and allows thread safe use of swing.
